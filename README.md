# MNIST Dataset Neural Network Practice
A simple two-layer neural network trained on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset hosted in Kaggle Notebook. Meant to be an instructional example to show the underlying math of neural networks better.
## Highlights
- NumPy Only, No Tensorflow/Keras
- Best Accuracy: 0.9026 after 500 iterations.
- Hyper-Parameter: alpha := 0.1
- Hidden Layers: 1
- Training Data: MNIST Dataset (Handwritten Ints: 1-9)
